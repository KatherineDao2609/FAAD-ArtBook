# .env
# This file holds environment variables (secrets) for your project.
# For example: MY_SECRET=abc123
# You can refer to these variables in your JavaScript like this:
# process.env.MY_SECRET
# Alternately, the "square bracket" syntax also works:
# process.env["MY_SECRET"]
# Note: for security reasons and to avoid publishing your secrets
# this file is ignored by Git (See also: .gitignore)
# ---
# Port 8000 is special.
# Code Server is configured to publish this port via our your Public URL
# Port forwarding happens automatically behind the scenes.
# You can reference this port in JavaScript using process.env.PORT
PORT=8000
